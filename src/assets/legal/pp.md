In alignment with Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution, as well as the data protection regulations established by the Federal Government, including the Data Protection Act (DSG), and in harmony with the principles outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we affirm every individual's right to safeguard their privacy and protect their personal data from misuse. We are committed to adhering to these principles, ensuring that personal data remains confidential and will not be traded or shared with third parties. For further information, please refer to the provided details below.

We appreciate your visit to our website and your interest in our offerings. Regarding external links to third-party content, we must emphasize that, despite our diligent content oversight, we bear no liability. This is because we did not initiate the transmission of this information, nor did we select or modify the recipient of the transmitted information, or the content itself.

Safeguarding your personal data throughout its collection, processing, and utilization during your visit to our website is of paramount importance to us. This protection is conducted in accordance with legal regulations, which you can find detailed information about by following the link provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

In most cases, you can use our website without the necessity of sharing personal data. When we do collect personal data on our website, such as names, addresses, or email addresses, we always aim to do so on a voluntary basis whenever possible. Rest assured, without your explicit consent, we will not share these data with third parties.

It's important to note that while we take stringent measures to protect your data, the transmission of information over the internet, such as in email communication, may have inherent security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, achieving absolute data protection against access by third parties under such circumstances is not feasible.

Next, we will outline the information we gather during your visit to our website and clarify how we utilize this information:

## 1. Collection and Storage of Personal Data and the Nature and Purpose of Their Use:

### a. When you visit our website: Each time you access our website, the internet browser used on your device (whether it's a computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) automatically transmits data to our analytics provider plausible.io.

- Specifications about the internet browser in use, and where applicable, the operating system of your device
- Location information, including location data about your country and city you access our webpage is obtained from your mobile device. Please be aware that on most mobile devices, you can manage or disable location services within the device's settings menu.

Our lawful interest, as per Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f DSGVO, underpins the data collection for the following objectives:

- Ensuring seamless connection setup and facilitating a user-friendly experience on the website.
- Assessing system security and stability.
- Supporting various administrative functions.

It's important to emphasize that under no circumstances do we employ the gathered data to draw conclusions about you.

### b. When establishing any form of contractual relationship or donating to our project, we will request the following personal information from you:

- Personally identifiable data, such as your legal name, email address and physical address.
- Other personal information that we are legally obliged or authorized to gather and process, which is essential for your authentication, identification, or validation of the collected data.

The aforementioned data will be processed to facilitate the execution of the contractual arrangement. Data processing is conducted in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. The duration of data retention is constrained by the contractual purpose and, where applicable, by statutory and contractual retention obligations.

## 2. Transfer of Personal Data

The transfer of your data with third parties, beyond the purposes detailed below, is not practiced. We exclusively share your data with third parties when:

- You have granted explicit consent for such sharing (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
- It is essential for the fulfillment of contractual obligations with you, such as sending a gift when you contribute to our project (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
- There exists a legal requirement for such disclosure (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR).
- Disclosure is imperative for asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims, and there is no predominant legitimate interest on your part in withholding your data (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).

In these instances, we ensure that the volume of transmitted data is kept to the minimum necessary. Our privacy practices adhere to relevant data protection laws, and data processing occurs exclusively within the European Union. There are no intentions or actions for data transfer to third countries.

## 3. Affected Rights

Upon your request, we are more than willing to provide you with information regarding the existence of clearly identifiable personal data related to you, as stipulated in Article 15 of the GDPR. This information includes details about the purposes of data processing, the categories of personal data involved, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed, the anticipated data retention period, your rights to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, or objection, the right to lodge a complaint, the source of your data if it wasn't collected from you directly, and the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling.

Furthermore, you possess the right to correct inaccurately collected personal data or supplement incomplete data, as articulated in Article 16 of the GDPR. Additionally, you can request that we restrict the processing of your data, provided that the legal conditions for doing so are met, in accordance with Article 18 of the GDPR. You also have the right to receive your personal data, pertaining to you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format or request its transfer to another data controller, as outlined in Article 20 of the GDPR. Moreover, you retain the "right to be forgotten," which means you can request the deletion of your personal data from our records, provided the legal prerequisites exist, in accordance with Article 17 of the GDPR. Your personal data will also be automatically deleted by us if the purpose of data collection has ceased to exist or if data processing has been unlawful.

In accordance with Article 7(3) of the GDPR, you maintain the right to revoke any consent you have previously given to us at any time. Consequently, we will no longer be authorized to process your data based on this consent in the future.

You also possess the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time, as long as such an objection is legally permitted. In the event of an effective revocation, we will automatically delete your personal data as per Article 21 of the GDPR. To exercise your right of revocation or objection, simply send an email to the address provided at the end of this privacy policy. Should there be any breaches of data protection regulations, you are entitled, in accordance with Article 77 of the DSGVO, to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

## 4. Duration of data storage

We will retain the data collected for as long as it is required for the execution of the contracts we have entered into, or until you choose to exercise your right to erasure or your right to transfer data to another company.
